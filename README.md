# 🌊 StreamLang: Data Pipelines Made Simple

StreamLang is a programming language designed to move and transform data without the "spaghetti code." Instead of deeply nested functions that are hard to read, StreamLang uses a **Pipeline** approach. Think of it like a factory line where data flows through different stations until it's finished.

### 🚀 Why StreamLang?
* **Clean Flow**: Use the `|>` operator to send data from one function to the next in a straight line.
* **Safety First**: The language checks your types before the code even runs, catching mistakes early.
* **Zero Magic**: Everything is explicit. What you see is exactly what happens.

### 📖 Project Navigation
To keep things organized, the documentation is split into three main parts:

1. **[Quick Start](docs/QUICK_START.md)**: How to get StreamLang running on your machine in under 60 seconds.
2. **[Language Guide](docs/LANGUAGE_GUIDE.md)**: A simple guide to writing StreamLang code, from variables to functions.
3. **[Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**: A technical overview of how StreamLang works under the hood.
