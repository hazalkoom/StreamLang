# 🚀 Progress Report: Building StreamLang

**Date:** December 27, 2025  
**Status:** Day 1 - Foundation Laid

## What I Accomplished Today

### 1. Set Up the Workshop
- Organized project folders (code vs. docs)
- Initialized Git for version control
- Created virtual environment for safe development

### 2. Defined the Language Rules
- Wrote ANTLR grammar (StreamLang.g4)
- Defined syntax for functions (`fn`), pipes (`|>`), and expressions
- Established the core language structure

### 3. Built the Parser
- Used ANTLR to generate Python parser code
- Fixed compatibility issues for Python 3.11
- Can now parse StreamLang source files

### 4. Key Lesson
Automation tools like ANTLR save time, but require manual fixes for modern environments.
