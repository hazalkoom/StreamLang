# 🛠️ Quick Start

Getting started is straightforward. Since StreamLang is built on Python, you just need to link it to your system.

### 1. Prerequisites
* **Python 3.10+**: Make sure your Python version is up to date.
* **Git**: To manage your code versioning.

### 2. Installation
Open your terminal in the project folder and run:
```bash
pip install -e .
```
This installs StreamLang in "editable" mode, meaning any changes you make to the code are updated instantly.

### 3. Verification
Run the full test suite to ensure your environment is set up correctly:

```bash
pytest
```
If all tests pass, you have a fully functional compiler ready to go!
